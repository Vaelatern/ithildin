[0: Preface / Requirements]:

Reading READMEs from start to finish is usually a good idea.  They tend to
contain a lot of information that is valid/valuable for 99% of users.  That
being said, I've tried to keep things short and to the point for those of you
who have little patience.  Before you start running the daemon, you should read
the below list of requirements to make sure you've got everything you need.

Requirements:
1. A modern Unix.  At the present time this system is not designed to run on
   anything but Unix and Unix-variant systems.  I will be doing a win32
   version "real soon now" unless Microsoft fires me and I go back to
   working on Unix systems as a dayjob. :)
2. Access to a C compiler, and a few megabytes of space.  You can install this
   system as a regular user, but you will need the compiler and space.
3. At least moderate knowledge of working with files on your system.  You're
   going to need to know how to edit configuration files, run programs, and
   probably move data around.  I've tried to make things fairly clear, but
   YMMV.
4. A module which you wish to run.  The base system doesn't come with any
   modules, you'll need to get them on your own.  There are some available
   from the site where the base system is hosted.
5. GNU Make.  On Linux this is invariably the regular 'make' which you
   already have.  On BSD systems (and others) it may be installed as
   'gmake'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1: Getting the source]:

The source code for ithildin can currently be retrieved from one of two
places: Subversion (like CVS) or the website.  If you 

* The website is at http://ithildin.org/dist/

* The subversion repository is located at:
  http://svn.ithildin.org/repo/trunk/ithildin
  To check out the latest code from the svn repository, you can do:
  $ svn co http://svn.ithildin.org/repo/trunk/ithildin
  If you do not have subversion installed on your system it can be retrieved
  from http://subversion.tigris.org/.  Please note that getting the svn copy
  of the source will give you every module in the system.  You might not
  want that.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2: Compiling]:

This system should be relatively straightforward to compile.  You'll need to do
the following:

1) Extract any modules you wish to use in the "modules/" directory.  For
example let us say you downloaded the "syslog" module package in your home
directory, you would do:
$ cd ithildin/modules
$ tar -zxf ~/syslog.tar.gz

2) If you got the source from svn, you'll need to generate a configure script.
This is done by using the 'autoconf' command, like so:
$ autoconf -o configure autoconf/configure.ac
If you downloaded the source from somewhere else this step is not necessary.

3) Configure the system using the configure script by doing:
$ ./configure --prefix=foo
(you might wish to run configure with the --help option to see if you're
interested in using any addons).  If you want to install system-wide you'll
probably want a prefix of '/usr' or '/usr/local'.  If you want to install in
your home directory, you'll probably want to use --prefix=/home/yourdir or
--prefix=/home/yourdir/ithildin (to keep it separate from other stuff).
And if you're installing in a home directory or somewhere separate from
other system binaries/libraries you will probably want to use the
--disable-dir-suffix option to configure.  It will keep the directory
structure in a cleaner condition.  Also, if you've got a bunch of stuff in
modules/ but you only want to compile some (or one) module you should do:
$ ./configure ... --with-modules="module1 module2 module3"
Replacing module1, etc with the names of the modules you want compiled and
installed.

4) Build the source by doing:
$ make
Any 'make' variant should suffice here.

That's it.  If all of this went well, then you can move on to the installing
step.  If not, see section 4.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3: Installing]:

Installation is, as building, relatively simple, you should be able to install
the system by simply doing:

$ make install

That's it.  If all went well, move on to the next section.  If not, see section
4.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[4: Running]:

You'll probably need to configure the system before you run it.  Look in
$prefix/etc/ithildin/ for the various configuration files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[5: Help!  It didn't work!]:

Right now there is no FAQ for "it didn't work" type issues, however you are
invited to file a defect (see the BUGS file) if you believe this is a defect
in the product and not an error in your configuration.
