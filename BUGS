If you believe you have found a bug in either the core system or the
provided modules you are invited to file a defect in our bug tracking
database.

When filing a bug please provide or be ready to provide the following:
- Host operating system, versions of major libraries
- (if built by you from code): Compiler and other build environment tools
- (if at all possible) a concise list of steps required to reproduce the bug
- Peculiar configuration details about your environment.  You may be
  requested to provide the entire configuration (contents of your etc
  directory).
- Log data (especially error/warning messages) around the time of the issue

If you are receiving a particular error message *PLEASE PLACE IT IN THE
BUG*.  This helps others to find your bug and avoids filing of duplicate
bugs.

Before filing a new defect you are encouraged to first peruse the existing
database to see if your defect has already been filed, and possibly fixed in
a later version.

The bug database is available at: http://bugs.ithildin.org/
